Project for the University of Texas - Data Science and Business Analytics certification course

Utilized unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to segment stocks in the stock market based on their attributes. This segmentation enables investors and analysts to identify groups of stocks that share common characteristics and behavior. It facilitates the detection of market trends, the assessment of portfolio diversification opportunities, and the formulation of investment strategies tailored to different clusters of stocks.
